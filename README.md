HTML Terminal
==========

Simulates the look of a terminal, with HTML and CSS. No JavaScript!

How it's done
==========

The basic idea is that it's simply a `div` spanning 100% width and height of the page. The trick to making it typable is the `contenteditable` attribute.

Beyond that, it's all about the styling to get that retro terminal look!
